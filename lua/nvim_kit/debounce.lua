local uv = vim.uv or vim.loop

--- A debouncer: `d.call(...)` (re)starts a timer of `ms` milliseconds and remembers the
--- arguments; when `ms` pass without another call, `fn` runs once with the arguments of the LAST
--- call. `d.cancel()` drops a pending call (also one whose timer has fired but whose run has not
--- come round yet) and returns whether there was one. `d.flush()` runs a pending call now,
--- synchronously, with its arguments, and returns true; with nothing pending it does nothing and
--- returns false. `fn` runs on the main loop (`vim.schedule`), so it may use the whole Neovim API;
--- an error in it surfaces like any scheduled callback's. `call` is safe from a fast callback
--- (`vim.uv` handlers). The timer is created here, so `new` must not run in a fast callback;
--- on `VimLeavePre` the timer is closed and a pending call is dropped, not run (`flush()` first
--- where it matters); `call` after that does nothing. Raises when `ms` is not a number >= 0 or
--- `fn` is not a function.
