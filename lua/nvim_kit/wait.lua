--- Call `start(cb)` and block, with `vim.wait`, until `cb` has been called or `timeout_ms` has
--- passed. Returns `value, true, handle` with the first value given to `cb`, or `nil, false,
--- handle` on timeout; the second result tells an answer of `nil` (`nil, true`) from no answer,
--- and `handle` is what `start` returned (a request handle to `cancel()` after a timeout). Only
--- the first argument of `cb` is kept: `cb(nil, err)` gives `nil, true`. Ctrl-C during the wait
--- ends `vim.wait` early and looks like a timeout. Later calls of `cb`
--- (a second answer, one after the timeout) are ignored. Events and callbacks keep running while
--- it waits. Must not be called from a fast callback (`vim.uv` handlers, `vim.system`'s
--- callbacks): it raises before `start` runs. Raises when `start` is not a function or `timeout_ms`
--- is not a number >= 0; an error in `start` propagates.
