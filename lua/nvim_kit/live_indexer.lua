-- The live indexer: one vector per note in memory, kept current note by note (`update`, `remove`,
-- `rename`), rebuilt all at once (`reindex_all`) or only where it is missing (`heal_missing`), and
-- written as one VRIX container with the guards of `index_guard` in front of every write. A
-- behavioural port of code-kit `live-indexer.ts` (tag 0.37.6, from vault-rag's `LiveIndexer`):
-- the same steps in the same order, so what it writes is byte for byte what vault-rag writes.
--
-- Everything outside is injected: the file store (`storage`), the embedding source (`embedder`)
-- and the way a note is read (`read`); there is no I/O in here besides them. The embedder is
-- asynchronous, by callback: `embedder(texts, cb)` with `cb(vectors)` (one list of numbers per
-- text) or `cb(nil, err)`. Call `cb` from the main loop: the indexer carries on right there and
-- then reads, decodes and writes files. A long run does not block Neovim: between two embedder
-- calls the indexer only does cheap work, and the next call waits for its answer. An embedder
-- that answers at once (a test double) works as well, with no recursion.
--
-- `dim` is the number of columns of the index (default 256, what vault-rag always wrote). An
-- index on disk with other columns is refused like one built with another model. `source_dim` in
-- the header is the length of the vectors the model returned before they were cut to `dim`: the
-- first one this indexer saw, else the value of the manifest it was initialised from, else `dim`.
--
-- Differences from the source, all of them about Lua and none about the bytes: results come by
-- callback or as `nil, err` instead of promises and exceptions; `read` is synchronous
-- (`read(path) -> text` or `nil, err`); numbers in the header are integers (`vrix.encode` raises
-- on a fraction, so a stamp or a `source_dim` that is no whole number is refused, not rounded);
-- a refusal text is English and no contract, the caller words its notice from `kind`.
--
-- Known limits. (1) An embedder answer that `vectors.to_index_vector` rejects (`{ vim.NIL }`,
-- `{ 42 }`) ends the run with `cb(nil, err)`, where the source counts a row of length 0 and `added`;
-- `llm.embed` checks its answer, so only a foreign embedder can get there. (2) Paths are ordered by
-- code point, as JS `.sort()` orders by UTF-16 unit: the two differ only for characters outside
-- the BMP (`！.md` U+FF01 against `😀.md`), and then the CRC differs from vault-rag's, so
-- "byte for byte what vault-rag writes" holds for every path inside the BMP (`text.byte_less`,
-- also used by `probe.order`).
